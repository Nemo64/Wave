Wave
====

This package can view metadata from a wave file. It also reads the data chunks and seperates it into multiple channels.
Each channel has its own amplitude values. This is useful if you want to render a waveform for instance.

## How to install

You can install with composer. Use a composer.json file with the following lines:

```
"minimum-stability": "dev",
"require": {
    "boyhagemann/wave": "dev-master"
}
```
